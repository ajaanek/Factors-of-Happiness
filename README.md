# Factors-of-Happiness

# Introduction
The data set I used is the World Happiness Report from Kaggle, specifically the 2019 data [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?resource=download). I chose this data set to try to find out the answer to the age-old question: what is the key to happiness? This data set includes the happiness scores and rankings from the Gallup World Poll, as well as different potential factors such as GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, trust in government, freedom, social support, etc [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report). Using this information, I will attempt to find which factors are most important for living a happy life so that individuals can focus on improving what will most likely make them happy. To do this, I will find out which parts of the world are the most happy, then any potential factors that might contribute to their higher happiness.
